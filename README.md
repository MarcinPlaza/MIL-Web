## MIL-Web

As of right now this is a general outline of a unified MIL site, it is written with React.js and basic css right now.
The site is mostly empty but there is a functional navbar that resizes and reformats to mobile.

The subjugator page has some ideas, there's an automatic image carousel, and a horizontal card system for a timeline of our submarines. 
lastly there is also implemented a table for member information.

    To run the site, in terminal while in the MIL-Web directory, type "npm start". It should compile and open http://localhost:3000/

All images are in the public folder, and pages are under src> components> pages...
